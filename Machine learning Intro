### Key Points on Machine Learning

#### **Introduction and Importance**
- **Use Case**: Diagnosing cell samples as benign or malignant.
- **Significance**: Early detection of malignant tumors is crucial for patient survival.

#### **Machine Learning Process**
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gather and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model on the dataset to recognize patterns.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

#### **Machine Learning Definition**
- **Definition**: Machine learning is a subfield of AI that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
